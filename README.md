# nextcloud-news-themes
This is a central repository to share custom themes created for the [Nextcloud News](https://github.com/nextcloud/news) webapp. Feel free to make pull requests to add your own. 
Changes should be limited to the custom.css file located in nextcloud/apps/news/css/custom.css.

## Installation 
1. git clone https://github.com/cwmke/nextcloud-news-themes.git
2. cd nextcloud-news-themes/themes
3. sudo cp <theme name>.css /usr/share/webapps/nextcloud/apps/news/css/custom.css
4. sudo chown 644 /usr/share/webapps/nextcloud/apps/news/css/custom.css
5. Enjoy!

I make no guarentee that themes will work with the current version of Nextcloud or that it will not break your cloud.
